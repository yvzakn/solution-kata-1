## Kata:

Am I Sick (from https://github.com/tedneward/ArchKatas)

Your company wants to build a software system supporting chat nurses (telehealth nurses) answering questions from customers about potential health problems.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users: 250+ nurses worldwide, hundreds to thousands of customers\
### Requirements:
* access patient medical histories\
* provide an service-level agreement on turnaround time for interaction\
* assist nurses in providing medical diagnosis\
* support nurses geographically divergent from clients\
* enable client customers to reach local medical staff (if necessary), contacting the local medical staff directly ahead of time (if necessary)\
* eventually enable parts of the system for direct client customer use\
### Additional Context:
* company is building software solutions in niche spaces like this one\
* aggressive growth with 2nd round VC funding\
* fast time to market is overall company goal to capture market\
* our lawyers have determined that the conversation is not considered a medical record

## Runbook

The group will be given a project (in many ways, an RFP–Request For Proposal) that needs development. The project team meets for a while, discovers requirements that aren’t in the original proposal by asking questions to the “customer” (the Moderator), discusses technology options that could work, and sketches out a rough vision of what the solution could look like. All deliverables will be checked into the given GitHub repository by the team. The project team must present their solution to the larger audience, and answer challenges (in the form of hard-but-fair questions). Once that challenge phase is done, the audience votes on the results.

Example deliverables on https://github.com/team7katas/sysopsquad can be shown to the participating team as an example to level set the deliverables expectations. 


* Team may ask the Moderator any questions they have about the project. The Moderator is the customer, the boss, the project manager, the IT ops guy…. Basically, the Moderator is everybody except the team.
* Any technology is fair game. Customers really don’t care, most of the time, what kind of technology the team will use. Just be prepared to defend its use during the Review Phase.
* You may safely make assumptions about technologies you don’t know well. However, any assumptions you make under this rule must be clearly defined and described during the Review Phase.
* Teams may not assume they have hiring/firing authority over the development team. No assumptions of developer All-Stars; assume that a development team roughly as skilled as the one you work with on a daily basis will be doing the implementation.


## Agenda (all Eastern Time):

12 - 12:20 pm (Participants: moderator, team members):
* Moderator sets expectations and reads the rules. Shows example deliverables to the team to set the deliverables expectations.
* Moderator creates a new private GitHub repository for each team and grants access to team members. (Repo may include the Kata problem and initial requirements already checked in by the Moderator)
* Moderator presents problem to the team and answers any questions
* Team discovers requirements by asking questions and discussing among themselves

12:30 - 2:20 pm (Participants: team members):
* Team meets and works on the solution
* Team discusses requirements, solution and technology options
* Team draws a rough vision of what the solution would look like
* Team documents the requirements, their solution and any other aspect of the solution they think necessary.
* Team prepares for a presentation to a larger audience
* Team can reach out to moderator through Slack during this phase for any extra questions
* Team checks their deliverables into the given GitHub repository (documents, images, diagrams, links to resources, Architecture Decision Records-ADRs etc.) 

2:30 - 3:00 pm (Participants: team members, moderator, engineering managers, optional invitees):
* Team presents their solution to larger audience
* Team answers challenges/questions by the audience, including the moderator
* Feedback and Solution Retrospective
* Final voting? (Thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs “meh” - out to the side)

After final review:
* Moderator makes sure that the deliverables are checked into the GitHub repository. 
* Moderator documents questions and feedback.
* Moderator documents the final voting result.
* Moderator puts all these items together and writes a small report with links to these documents. (GitHub repo or a Google Doc)
